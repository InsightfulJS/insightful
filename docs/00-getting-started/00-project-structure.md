## Project Architecture

## docs/

In your project's documentation, the "docs" directory is the heart of your content. This directory is where you organize and structure all the documentation pages, sections, and subsections for your website. It's important to understand how the directory structure and prefix numbering work to effectively manage your documentation.

### Directory Hierarchy

The "docs" directory is organized hierarchically, consisting of sections and subsections. Each section is represented by a folder, and within each section folder, you can have multiple pages and nested subsections.

### Prefix Numbering

A key feature of our documentation structure is prefix numbering. Each section folder and page within it is prefixed with a number followed by an underscore. This numbering system helps control the order and hierarchy of sections and pages on your website. It ensures that your documentation appears in the desired sequence.

### Example

Let's look at an example to understand this structure better. Suppose you have the following "docs" directory:

```bash
docs/
    01_getting_started/
        01_introduction.md
        02_installation.md
    02_configuration/
        01_general_settings.md
        02_advanced_options.md
    03_usage/
        01_basic_usage.md
        02_advanced_features.md

```
