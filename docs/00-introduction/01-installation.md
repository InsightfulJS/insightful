## Concept

Wolfhunter is an 8-bit RPG where you play as a hunter facing off against a werewolf, in a Pokemon-like combat sequence.

## Gameplay

I set out to make a game loop that felt similar to the combat in [Pokemon Red/Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue), which was the most popular title on the [original Nintendo Gameboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy).

### Core Mechanics

The units take turns to fight. The game ends when one of the character's HP is reduced to 0.

Each turn, the player has two basic abilities that can be used for free.
