## How To Use

By default, **insightful** comes with its own code block design and highlighting. You can use it easily by defining a standard markdown codeblock and specifying the language.

## Example

{% codepanel %}

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

{% /codepanel %}
