**Banner** is an aesthetic way to display news or an announcement at the forefront of your documentation. It can be a static statement or a clickable link, here are some examples that you can use.

You can use a banner on an individual page in your documentation to highlight something about that section, or you can place it in your `home.md` file to share something that is global.

## Examples

### Style: Simple

{% banner title="New!" href="http://google.com" text="This is a link banner" /%}

{% banner title="Announcement!" text="This is a news banner" /%}

### Style: Glow

{% glowbanner title="New!" href="http://google.com" text="This is a link banner"/%}

{% glowbanner title="Announcement!" text="This is a news banner" /%}
